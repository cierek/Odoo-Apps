If you like the Apps please leave a star(top right corner), donate using PayPal (piotr.w.cierkosz@gmail.com) or simply buy any of my Apps in the Odoo App Store (https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?author=Piotr%20Cierkosz).

You can also join me in creation of new Apps or I can join you - this would bring us some new experience and more apps under our belt.

Kind regards,
